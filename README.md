# saints-xctf

Saintsxctf.com is my very first website.  It is a team running log website made specifically for the St. Lawrence Cross Country
and Track & Field teams.  With other team based running log websites being shut down, this was a great alternative for the team.
It is also my way of giving back.

## Technologies

The Website is built using the LAMP stack.  Server side operations are done in PHP with client side working in a JQuery flavor
of Javascript.  The database is built in MySQL.  

The website also has a REST API backend.  I chose this approach to meet my multi device needs.  I currently have an Android
app in beta stages and future plans for an IOS app.

You can follow development of the android app here: [SaintsXCTF Android GitHub](https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-android)

The website itself is still in beta stages of development, and it is the main priority over the android and ios apps.
